/*React: Use a Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering
Before moving on to dynamic rendering techniques, there's one last way to use built-in JavaScript conditionals to render what you want: the ternary operator. The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for if/elsestatements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust as traditional if/elsestatements, but they are very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, if/elsestatements can't be inserted directly into JSX code. You might have noticed this a couple challenges ago â€” when an if/elsestatement was required, it was always outside the returnstatement. Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but you can combine several ternary expressions together. Here's the basic syntax:

condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse

The code editor has three constants defined within the CheckUserAgecomponent's render()method. They are called buttonOne, buttonTwo, and buttonThree. Each of these is assigned a simple JSX expression representing a button element. First, initialize the state of CheckUserAgewith inputand userAgeboth set to values of an empty string.

Once the component is rendering information to the page, users should have a way to interact with it. Within the component's returnstatement, set up a ternary expression that implements the following logic: when the page first loads, render the submit button, buttonOne, to the page. Then, when a user enters their age and clicks the button, render a different button based on the age. If a user enters a number less than 18, render buttonThree. If a user enters a number greater than or equal to 18, render buttonTwo.*/


/*TESTS
The CheckUserAgecomponent should render with a single inputelement and a single buttonelement.
Passed
The CheckUserAgecomponent's state should be initialized with a property of userAgeand a property of input, both set to a value of an empty string.
Passed
When the CheckUserAgecomponent is first rendered to the DOM, the button's inner text should be Submit.
Passed
Your code should not contain any if/elsestatements.
Passed
When a number of less than 18 is entered into the inputelement and the buttonis clicked, the button's inner text should read You Shall Not Pass.
Passed
When a number greater than or equal to 18 is entered into the inputelement and the buttonis clicked, the button's inner text should read You May Enter.
Passed
Once a number has been submitted, and the value of the inputis once again changed, the buttonshould return to reading Submit.
